2) skip summary generation
3) minimum 3-4 sentences and don't go over a page. Use the estimateCharsPerPage function in pagination.ts to determine how long to make the summary.
4) we don't want to cache the result. It should be in variable for example currentSummary. It should return a string of the current summary.
5) The first character of the current page (page.startCharIndex)
6) it should show an error message instead of the summary.
